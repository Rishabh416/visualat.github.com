        <p>Many learning activities for pupils rely on the act of reading. Literacy is a necessary skill and knowledge in today's communities for a wide range of work-related, leisure, and other life-sustaining activities. AT for reading and learning is determined by the student's visual functioning and literacy level, as well as the surroundings and task demands. These tools aid peopleâ€™s ability to participate academically and afterwards in life wherever feasible. Large print books, multiple window typo scopes, optical magnifiers, DAISY books, braille reading materials, refreshable braille display, and screen readers are a few examples of technologies that assist pupils to read.</p>

        <p>Students with visual impairments and blindness confront several obstacles while completing writing assignments that require traditional writing and visual writing, such as ink on paper or typing on a computer screen. People with visual impairment and blindness may struggle to master the mechanics of writing (e.g., punctuation and spelling), as well as taking notes that rely on visually oriented concepts and information. Although this visual information is not widely available in a format that visually impaired students can easily access, there are some devices that can be used for science teaching, such as tactile maps, tactile diagram set for sciences, tactile anatomy atlas, animal models, plants, or three-dimensional models objects, such as the DNA twist model.</p>
