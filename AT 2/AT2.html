        <p>Orientation and mobility are important components of people's learning. It is crucial for kids with visual disabilities to learn to move safely and freely across environmental surroundings using their remaining senses. People should be taught how to navigate through everyday locations safely. Long walking canes, children's walking canes, and support canes are examples of mobility devices.</p>

    <div class="para" id="b">
        <p>For their everyday life tasks, people with visual disabilities require a variety of assistive devices. These assistive technologies improve their freedom and productivity in ordinary tasks. There are assistive devices accessible for everyday life activities; Liquid level sensors, talking color detectors, talking watch or alarm clocks, and talking money identifiers are a few examples. Color filters or tinted glasses are another piece of gear that aids people with color blindness. It tints the incoming image so that their eyes see normal colors. </p>
